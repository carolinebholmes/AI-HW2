For our pathfinding algorithm under certainty is the A* algorithm using the length of the minimal possible path given no obstables as our heuristic. A* is a variation of Dijkstra's, so it guaranteed to find the shortest path given that the heuristic is consistent. It can better performance than Dijkstra's, as the heuristic allows it to prioritize paths that are more likely to be the shortest.
